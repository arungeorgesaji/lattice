# lattice

Lattice is a computational engine where all data exists as interconnected grids and every operation flows through spatial transformations. It provides unified primitives for working with multidimensional data—from simple 1D arrays to complex 3D structures—treating numbers, text, images, and even code as points in a navigable matrix. Rather than just another math library, Lattice enforces a grid-native paradigm where computation becomes spatial manipulation: filters become grid convolutions, neural networks become layered grid transformations, and physical simulations operate on discretized spatial fields. This core abstraction enables infinite expansion across domains—image processing, AI modeling, physics engines, and language design—all built atop the same fundamental grid operations, creating a foundation where data and space are fundamentally unified.
